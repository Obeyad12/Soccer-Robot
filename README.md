# Soccer Robot âš½ðŸ¤–  
*An award-winning remote-controlled soccer robot designed for the TMU Engineering Competition (Best Design Award).*  

## Overview
The Soccer Robot is a custom-built Arduino-based robot designed for remote-controlled soccer matches.  
It combines a durable 3D-printed chassis, robust motor control via an H-Bridge, and Bluetooth-based wireless control.  
The project received the **Best Design Award** at the TMU Engineering Competition for its combination of mechanical durability and reliable electronics.  

## Demo Video
ðŸŽ¬ [Gameplay Montage](https://youtube.com/shorts/CDA8o7iQ37w) â€“ Watch the robot in action during the competition.  

## Features
- **Arduino Nano + C++ programming:** efficient embedded control.  
- **Bluetooth communication:** remote control via wireless input for real-time gameplay.  
- **H-Bridge motor driver:** smooth PWM-based motor control for forward, reverse, and turning.  
- **Optimized chassis design:** CAD-modeled and 3D-printed parts for maximum grip and durability.  
- **Validated electronics:** oscilloscope + multimeter used to test PWM stability and driver response.  
- **Award-winning design:** won *Best Design* at TMU Engineering Competition.  

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Arduino Nano, H-Bridge motor driver, DC motors, Bluetooth module, 3D-printed chassis.  
- **Software:** Arduino C++ for PWM control + Bluetooth input handling.  
- **Tools:** Fusion 360 for CAD design, Arduino IDE, oscilloscope & multimeter for verification.  

## How It Works
1. The Arduino Nano receives control signals wirelessly via Bluetooth.  
2. Signals are translated into PWM outputs to the H-Bridge, driving left/right motors for precise movement.  
3. CAD-designed 3D-printed chassis ensures stability, traction, and crash resistance during gameplay.  
4. The robot can maneuver quickly across the playing field while withstanding collisions.  

## CAD Models
All parts were modeled in Fusion 360 and 3D printed for assembly.
