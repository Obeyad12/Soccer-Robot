# Soccer Robot âš½ðŸ¤–  
*An award-winning remote-controlled soccer robot designed for the TMU Engineering Competition (Best Design Award).*  

## Overview
The Soccer Robot is a custom-built Arduino-based robot designed for remote-controlled soccer matches.  
It combines a durable 3D-printed chassis, robust motor control via an H-Bridge, and Bluetooth-based wireless control.  
The project received the **Best Design Award** at the TMU Engineering Competition for its combination of mechanical durability and reliable electronics.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** Arduino Nano, H-Bridge motor driver, DC motors, Bluetooth module, 3D-printed chassis.  
- **Software:** Arduino C++ for PWM control + Bluetooth input handling.  
- **Tools:** Fusion 360 for CAD design, Arduino IDE, oscilloscope & multimeter for verification.  

## How It Works
1. The Arduino Nano receives control signals wirelessly via Bluetooth.  
2. Signals are translated into PWM outputs to the H-Bridge, driving left/right motors for precise movement.  
3. CAD-designed 3D-printed chassis ensures stability, traction, and crash resistance during gameplay.  
4. The robot can maneuver quickly across the playing field while withstanding collisions.
